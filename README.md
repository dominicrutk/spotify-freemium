# Spotify Freemium

This MacOS application automatically restarts Spotify when an ad plays. This behavior allows users who don't subscribe to Spotify Premium to enjoy an ad-free listening experience. It is perfect for developers who want to listen to music while working.

This project was inspired by the now-archived [MuteSpotifyAds](https://github.com/simonmeusel/MuteSpotifyAds). It is mostly just for my own practice developing in Rust.
